## The process of clinical drug development is highly regulated{.smaller}

> In clinical drug development the goal is produce reliable evidence on whether or not a product is both safe and efficacious 

This process involves multi-disciplinary stakeholders coming together to review evidence which is generated a highly regulated manner. 

. . . 

::: {.callout-note}
# Working a regulated way as a statistician or programmer in pharma has three key pillars? 
1. Traceable   
2. Reproducible
3. Accurate
:::


## How do we manage tech evolution and adaption in pharma? 
- Big-bang, disrutptive change takes time in a regulated environment.  

- Non-disruptive change can help us make incremental progress to get ready for change. 

. . . 

:::{.callout-tip}
# Non-disruptive change for automated report generation 
Let's bring the modern tooling and practices to static document generation so that we can retain reproducibilty and work at scale. 
:::


## From data to evidence
![](images/workflow_old.png){width="60%"}  

- Report generation relies on copying and pasting static outputs into a document
- This can be error prone, time consuming and doesn't scale. 

## Additional pathway using {rdocx}
![](images/workflow_new.png){width="60%"}


- We created a new package {rdocx} and process that leverages good data science practices that can generate company compliant reports


## Use case: sample size estimation and reporting
::: {.callout-note}
# What: Sample size report generation
Our trial statisticans estimate and document the sample size for studies using a company template in docx format. It is mandatory that the report complies with the company template.

:::

. . . 

::: {.callout-tip}
# How: successful development and change is so much more than good code

  1. Get experts onboard (compliance, statisicians)
  2. Co-design
  3. Leverage good software development practices
  4. Develop incrementally, demo-ing regularly

## Let's make a title page {.smaller}

Mandatory elements are represented as R6 classes where each attribute has a unique input requirement that goes through a series of checks.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="52%"}

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
tp <- rdocx::TitlePage$new(
  compound= "Compound",
  study_number = "Study number",
  study_title = "Study title",
  doc_status = "Final",
  release_date  = "01-Jul-2024",
  n_pages = "10")

# Generates the title page
tp$get_title_page()
```
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}

## Let's make a change log{.smaller}

Mandatory elements are represented as R6 classes where each attribute has a unique input requirement that goes through a series of checks.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="52%"}
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Initiate change log table
changelog_table <- rdocx::ChangelogTable$new() 
 
row_1 <- rdocx::ChangelogTableRow$new(

  time_point = 'Before protocol finalization',
  reason_update = 'Creation of first version',
  outcome_update = 'NA - First version',
  section_title_impacted = 'NA')

changelog_table$add_row(row_1)

## Let's make a complete report

Check document template and render:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
rdocx::print_ss_template_version()
```

::: {.fragment}

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
rdocx::rmd_render(
  rmd_filename = "path/to/rmd_file",
  output_path= "path/to/final_docx",
  report_type = "sample_size",
  version = 00
)
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
A log file will be generated documenting the following:

:::{.column-page style="font-size: 80%;"}
- User, system, date and time
- Final document name and location
- Location of R packages and R session info (`sessionInfo()`)
:::

## Inspect compiled document

## We embedded {rdocx} in good software development practices

We use object-oriented (R6 classes) to structure our package. 

![](images/rdocx_structure_1.jpg)

## We embedded {rdocx} in good software development practices

We could create many assertions to do perform upfront checks. 
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
tp <- rdocx::TitlePage$new(
  compound= "Compound",
  study_number = "Study number",
  study_title = "Study title",
  doc_status = "Final",
  release_date  = "01-07-2024",
  n_pages = "10")
```


```
Error in check_string_is_date(release_date) : 
  `Date` was not provided in the expected format (%d-%b-%Y). For example: 01-Oct-2023
``` 
## We embedded {rdocx} in good software development practices

We have automated tests and check for each incremental change in to the rdocx package. 

![](images/rdocxCICD.png)

## What's next

- We plan to open-source our {rdocx} package with a generic template example
- We want to adapt it to more use-cases, e.g. pre-clinical safety report
